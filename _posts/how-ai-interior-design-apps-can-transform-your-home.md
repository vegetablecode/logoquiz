## Best AI Interior Design Apps

There are many AI interior design apps available on the market, but not all of them are created equal. Here are some of the best ones that we recommend:

- **Modsy**: Modsy is an online interior design service that uses AI to create personalized and realistic 3D designs of your space. You can upload photos of your room, answer a few questions, and get a design plan within a few days. You can then edit the design, swap items, and shop directly from the app. Modsy also offers unlimited revisions and access to professional designers for an extra fee.
- **Havenly**: Havenly is another online interior design service that uses AI to match you with the best designer for your project. You can choose from three packages: Mini, Full, and Build. The Mini package includes a design concept, a curated shopping list, and one revision. The Full package includes everything in the Mini package, plus a 3D rendering, a floor plan, and unlimited revisions. The Build package includes everything in the Full package, plus project management and installation services.
- **Planner 5D**: Planner 5D is a free app that lets you create and visualize your own 2D and 3D designs. You can choose from thousands of items, materials, and colors, and customize them to your liking. You can also view your designs in HD, 3D, or VR. Planner 5D also has a community of users who share their designs and ideas on the app.
