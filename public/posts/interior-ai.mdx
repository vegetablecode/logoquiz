## 3. Greater Creativity

AI could help designers to generate design ideas and possibilities. For example, AI can be used to generate design options that would be difficult or impractical to create manually, or may simply have not been considered. An interior designer could quickly explore mood boards that might otherwise take a long time to assemble. This could lead to more innovative and creative designs.
